#### State machine and building UI
***
 based on the talk given by [RubÃ©n Sospedra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouq0qkkIPM)

    Î£ is the input alphabet(finite non-empty set)  ðŸ¤“


_NOTE: it can be any thing like types in action etc not getting at this point will make sence once i have complete this thing_


```javascript
const alphabet = {
    LOCK:'LOCK',
    UNLOCK: 'UNLOCK'
}
```

```javascript 

```
S is a finite, non-empty set of states ðŸ¤“

```javascript 
    const LOCK = {...};
    const UNLOCK = {...};
```
sÂº is initial state, an element of S ðŸ¤“
```javascript 

const initial = state[FIRST];
```

Î´ is the transition function :Î´ : S  X   Î£  --> S
```javascript 

const transition = (machine, state) => {
    return machine[current].next
}
```

smaple state machine will be 

```javascript 
const machine = {
    LOCK:{
        next:UNLOCK
    },
    UNLOCK:{
        next: LOCK
    }
}

const INITIAL = LOCK;

const transition = (current) => machine[current].next
```
