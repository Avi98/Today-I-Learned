Above is the image show how V8 engine works. So follwoing is the process how it works

>Working of JS 
js engine parses the code into **Abstract syntax tree**, which is then feed into **interpreter** which produces byte code. At this point js engine is *running your code*. However to run this code mre smoothly there is **optimizing compiler** in which some profiling data is collect and feed into this optimizing compiler, this way a highly optimized code is generated.

#### Array 

>Note: Last index that an array can have is **`2**32 - 2`** 

#### How JS engine represent objects and objects shape

Above shows how js objects represented in engines now a days.
Engine stores shape separately than the values

![Object representation ](https://github.com/Avi98/Today-I-Learned/blob/master/images/js%20Object%20representation.png)

so now if have same shape but diff values new jsObject will be created but only one shape dictionary will be created and all will be pointing to same shape instead of duplicating. Hence saving the memory.

###### Cool now!  how js engine finds new shape.

Suppose if we add new objects to shapes like this :

```javascript

const o = {};

o.x = 5;
o.y = 6;

```

![Object representation ](https://github.com/Avi98/Today-I-Learned/blob/master/images/js%20obj%20property.png) 

js engine keeps on appending the value to object and then its recorded in shape  inside property information that it can be found at offset 0
